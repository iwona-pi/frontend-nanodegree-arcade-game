# Classic Arcade Game Clone
## About
This project is required for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. Classic Arcade Game Clone is simple recreation of Frogger Game. I had really lot of fun writing this game:smile:

## Instruction

* If you want to move left click <kbd>←</kbd>.

### How to play?
The figure you see down the gameboard is you. The horrible bugs you see walking pass the screen are enemies. Your goal is to walk through gameboard and rich the water. When you do that you win! And when you win .... Start play to see what happens.

#### Danger!!!
Be careful with bugs. If you crash with one of them you have to come back to start position and play again.

## Note
Game is based on Object-Oriented JavaScript. What I created is set in app.js file.
