# Classic Arcade Game Clone
## About
This is project required for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. Classic Arcade Game Clone is simple recreation of Frogger Game. I had really lot of fun writing this game:smile:

## Instruction
### How to run?
* Press <kbd>↑</kbd> to move up.
* Press <kbd>→</kbd> to move right.
* Click <kbd>↓</kbd> when you want to move down.
* If you want to move left click <kbd>←</kbd>.

## How to play?
The figure you see down the gameboard is you. The horrible bugs you see walking pass the screen are enemies. Your goal is to walk through gameboard and rich the water. When you do that you win! And when you win .... Start play to see what happens.

### Danger!!!
Be careful with bugs. If you crash with one of them you have to come back to start position and play again.


Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
